# You choped your arm off.

After days of pain you lost the ablity to feel pain.

You bandeged your arm and now have a nube instead of a hand. 

As you go searching for supplies you have encountered a fork in the road.  

# Which way will you go North or South. 

# [Go North](gang.md)
# [Go South](shelter.md)
