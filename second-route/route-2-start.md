## So you chose to stay put, not really knowing what is going on.

_5 minutes later, you heard someone knocking on the door. Trying to pry it open. You see that you do not have much time left._  

A mysterious portal opened up with sparks of aether material and sparks of rainbow essence.  

You see a military grade shovel that you have not idea where it came from or where it originated.  
What should you do?
