# Getting through the backdoor took a while. But you manage to make it to the bio fluid generator.  
With max force, you impale the generator with a terminal velocity of 300000000000000000 m/s.

This created a flash at every corner as the magic from the sword flows through the world. Purifying the corruption.

You woke up from a nightmare, and see that you are on your bed with your friends calling you from outside. :)
