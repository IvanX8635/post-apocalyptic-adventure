# You took a sword that has been broken thousands of years ago.  
It was a magical sword of vigor and power. Forged by the magical nature and its innate animals.

As you took hold of the sword, you feel sadness, bitter sweet feeling of regret, and the thought of reality.  

You know that there is one thing you have to do.  
To purify the world from the corruption.  
First, you must set a path.
